# The Movie App

This repository contains the sample app you asked me to implement. You can either download directly the APK from the release section, or build it youself.

Some note about my work:

  - I have include in this repo the keystore and google-service.json files, something that we should **never** do, but to simplify your reviewers life I did.
  - I have done some unit test, but not all of them. I think the important thing here was to show you how I implement them in general.
  - Funny fact: I found some 'bugs' in the API you asked me to work with :)

I stay available for any further questions, and hope you will appreciate the app (even if the UI is not very 'sexy').
